# QA Automation Python Test

## Task 1 - Magic List
### Created a Python class that implements a simplified list by skipping boundary checks.

### Frameworks and Programs:
* PyCharm

For implementing the class, the class I wrote is returning a list with an None inside and by that it passed the exceptions of a regular list.


## Task 2 - API Testing
### Create a test suite for the API.

### Frameworks and Programs:
* PyCharm
* Postman
* Pytest
* Unittest

I used Postman for checking results manually and for converting the http requests, also I used Pytest wrapped with Unittest as a suite controller.
